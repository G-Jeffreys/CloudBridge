# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name
**CloudBridge for OpenOffice**

## Summary
CloudBridge is an extension for Apache OpenOffice that adds modern cloud storage integration and lightweight collaborative editing features. It enables users to open and save documents directly to cloud services (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox), while preventing conflicts through edit-time locking and keeping collaborators informed via Slack notifications.

## Goals
- Integrate OpenOffice with modern cloud storage providers.
- Enable basic collaboration through lock files and messaging.
- Avoid overwrites and editing conflicts in shared documents.
- Provide user feedback and notifications via Slack.

## Features
### 1. Cloud Storage Integration
- OAuth 2.0 login for Google Drive and Dropbox
- Browse and select files from cloud storage
- Open/save files directly to/from the cloud
- Cloud versioning and metadata tracking

### 2. Edit-Time Locking
- Create lock file on cloud storage when editing begins
- Display warning if lock exists on file open
- Remove lock on save or close
- Lock file includes user, timestamp, machine

### 3. Slack Notifications
- Send webhook messages on open, save, and close events
- Configurable Slack webhook URL
- Custom message templates with emojis and file metadata

### 4. Preferences Panel
- Configure Slack webhook URL
- Set display name for notifications
- Choose default cloud provider

## Non-Goals
- Real-time collaborative editing (e.g., live cursors)
- Full cloud document rendering
- Support for Microsoft OneDrive (MVP only: Google Drive, Dropbox)

## Technical Constraints
- Must function as an OpenOffice extension using UNO API
- All functionality must be localâ€”no custom backend
- Securely store access and refresh tokens locally

## Success Criteria
- Functional `.oxt` extension installable via OpenOffice Extension Manager
- Successful cloud login and file open/save cycle
- Lock file correctly prevents simultaneous edits
- Slack messages delivered for document lifecycle events

## Future Enhancements
- Support OneDrive and Box
- Add "Force Unlock" capability
- Provide daily edit summaries
- Zapier integration for workflow automation
